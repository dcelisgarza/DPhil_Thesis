# Corrections

- [x] Add a section reviewing DDD efforts to date.
  - [x] This should include references to early work on edge-screw codes
    - [x] Devincre and others,
    - [x] TRIDIS
    - [x] microMegas
    - [x] including Novokshanov and Roberts if they ever published it,
  - [x] the advances to nodal codes, and
    - [x] a survey of the various existing DDD codes out there.
    - [x] Include references to the Stanford/Livermore ParaDiS code,
    - [x] the work of Zbib, and also
    - [x] the current work of Fivel and collaborators,
    - [x] Dupuy,
    - [x] Ghoniem/Sun,
    - [x] and Giacomo Po’s code MODEL. Make sure the big papers are cited (e.g. Bulatov’s Nature papers, and those of Arsenlis, Cai, Marian).
  - [x] LLNL (Arsenlis/Rhee?) did 3D FEM coupling 15 years ago too.
- [ ] Add a brief section on alternative approaches
  - [ ] e.g. dislocation density-based theories of Sandfeld and Hochrainer (near where you discuss level-set methods), and
- [x] where DD sits in the multiscale hierarchy in comparison with DFT, MD, kMC, large scale FEM as discussed in viva.
- [x] (Eshelby) inclusions can’t be mentioned without citing Eshelby!
- [x] Mention the anisotropic work of Fitzgerald and Aubry (I think MODEL is aniso too?) and where anisotropy is important (e.g. hot Fe)/can be neglected (e.g. W).
- [x] Nonlinearity of velocity response: work of Fitzgerald and Tarleton/Roberts. Did Bruce work on this too?
- [x] Put the section on DDD.jl into its own chapter.
- [ ] Clearly state where your work has advanced the field,
  - [x] e.g. in the EasyDD algorithm 1.1
  - [ ] show haiyang's loading and unloading simulation to show it.
  - [x] Clarify the part in future where you mention the others' work.
- [x] Spell check throughout and check references – some are repeated
  - [x] e.g. 92 and 156.
  - [x] It’s Frank-Read rather than Reed.
- [x] Page 110: figs 5.1, 5.2, 5.4(a, b) need citations or credits
