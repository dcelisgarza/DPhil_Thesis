\section{Notation and abbreviation}
\label{s:nota}

For the sake of clarity the following notation and abbreviation conventions have been used:
\begin{itemize}
	\item GPU: Graphics Processing Unit.
	\item CPU: Central Processing Unit.
	\item Tensors are denoted by sans serif bold italics, $ \tns{T} $.
	\item Matrices are denoted by serif bold Roman, $ \mtx{M} $.
	\item Vectors are denoted by serif bold italics, $ \vec{V} $.
	\item Scalars are denoted by serif italics, $ S $.
	\item Operators and special functions are Roman, $\exp(x)$, $\det{\mtx{J}}$.
	\item Angles are in radians unless otherwise stated.
	\item Einstein notation for tensor components is used unless otherwise stated.
	\item Individual items, be they nodes, surface elements, dislocation segments or indices are denoted by a lower-case subscript to the right, $a_n$.
	\item Ensembles are denoted by an upper-case subscript to the right, $a_N \coloneqq \sum a_n$.
	\item Host variables (CPU variables in parallelisation) are denoted by a Roman h-superscript on the left, $\hvar{a}$.
	\item Global device variables (global variables visible only to the GPU) are denoted by a Roman d-superscript on the left, $\dvar{a}$.
	\item Thread variables (variables visible only to a GPU thread) are denoted by a Roman t-superscript on the left, $\tvar{a}$.
	\item Serial indices/counters are the traditional $i$, $j$, $k$, etc.
	\item Parallel indices are denoted as Roman variables, $\rvar{a}$.
	\item Pseudo-code is C-style---row-major order, 0-based indexing---because it provides a more direct translation of the C-code.
	\item Big-O, $\mathcal{O}$, Big-Theta, $\Theta$, and Big-Omega, $\Omega$, notation are used to respectively denote upper, mean and lower asymptotic bounds.
\end{itemize}

\section{Typesetting}
\label{s:typeset}

In the digital version of this document, \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eh7lp9umG2I}{URLs}, commits, and filenames are hyperlinks to the relevant websites.

The repository \href{https://github.com/dcelisgarza/latex_templates}{https://github.com/dcelisgarza/latex\_templates} contains the custom document class used to typeset this document. It was compiled with \hologo{XeLaTeX} and \hologo{BibTeX}. We recommend compiling the source with \hologo{XeLaTeX} or \hologo{LuaLaTeX}. Requires \texttt{minted}, \href{https://ctan.org/pkg/minted?lang=en}{\texttt{https://ctan.org/pkg/minted?lang=en}} and its dependencies to compile.
\section{Diagrams}
\label{s:diag}

All diagrams were drawn with Inkscape: Open Source Scalable Vector Graphics Editor, \href{https://inkscape.org/}{\texttt{https://inkscape.org/}}, ``Draw Freely.''
