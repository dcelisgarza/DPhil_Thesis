\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Experimental setup}
\label{ss:experimentalSetup}

In total, eight loading tests were carried out.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Loading in the $\langle 1\, 0\, 0 \rangle$:
          \begin{enumerate}
              \item Two tests with a loading rate of $\SI{5}{\nano\metre\per\second}$.
              \item Two tests with a loading rate of $\SI{500}{\nano\metre\per\second}$.
          \end{enumerate}
    \item Loading in the $\langle 1\, 1\, 0 \rangle$:
          \begin{enumerate}
              \item Two tests with a loading rate of $\SI{5}{\nano\metre\per\second}$.
              \item Two tests with a loading rate of $\SI{500}{\nano\metre\per\second}$.
          \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

The cross-section of the micropillars was well-known at $\SI{12}{\micro\metre} \times \SI{12}{\micro\metre}$, however the length was postulated to be $\sim \SI{30}{\micro\metre}$.

The initial dislocation configuration was not well known but was postulated to be approximately 10 dislocations per square micron. The total length of mobile dislocations influences how much plasticity we observe. Furthermore, the Frank-Reed (FR) source length was unknown. A dislocation line's yield stress is inversely proportional to its length,
\begin{align}
    \sigma_\rvar{y} & = \dfrac{\mu b}{l}\,,
\end{align}
where $\sigma_\rvar{y}$ is the yield stress, $\mu$ the shear modulus, $b =  \vec{b} $, and $l$ the dislocation line length. Both of these parameters had to be estimated and refined by running probing simulations.

The tensile tests were set up as shown in \cref{f:expSetup}. The pillars were placed under tensile load in the $x$-direction but were free to move in the $xy$-plane, which would naturally happen as dislocations exit the surface and create slip steps.

It is worth noting that the timescale of dislocation plasticity simulations make them unsuitable to simulate the entirety of the experiments. EasyDD also does not have the capability to dynamically remesh its finite elements, so it cannot account for fracture. For the same reason, simulation loading rates are higher than experimental ones, we expand on this in \cref{ss:modelSetup}.

\subsection{Dislocation plasticity setup}
\label{ss:modelSetup}

The material parameters of the samples were also not known, so they were estimated from comercially available manufacturing spec sheets and measurements reported from literature. The exact values used for the lattice parameter, shear modulus and Poisson ratio are: $a \coloneqq \SI{3.499}{\angstrom}$, $ \mu  \coloneqq \SI{79e3}{\mega\pascal}$, $\nu \coloneqq 0.31$ respectively. The lattice parameter is from \cite{ni_lattice} and the othters are the mean of the upper and lower values reported by \cite{azom_nickel}.

We used prismatic loops with four sides as Frank-Reed sources to seed the domain with dislocations. Preliminary simulations showed the initially assumed dislocation density was too high, instead it was dropped to a single seed loop per active slip system. For the $\langle 1\, 0\, 0 \rangle$ loading direction, this was 8 loops, and for $\langle 1\, 1\, 0 \rangle$ it was only 4; \cref{t:slipSystems} contains the active slip systems for both scenarios.

The pillar length was defined as $\SI{36}{\micro\metre}$, or $3\times$ the length of one of the sides of the square cross-section. The extra length acts as a buffer zone for simulating dislocations moving into the bulk, where they pile up. In the simulation, they stick to the end of the cantilever, as per \cref{c:surfRem}.

We define surface node sets $\left\{\forall (x, y, z) \in [0,\, 1] \vert S_{xyz} \in \partial \hat{V}\right\}$, where $\hat{V}$ is a unit volume such that $S_{000}$ denotes the node at the origin, $S_{x00}$ the $x$-axis spanning edge at $y,\, z=0$, and $S_{xy0}$ the $xy$-plane at $z=0$. We use these node sets to define our Neuman (displacement) boundary conditions as follows.
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{align}
        S_{0yz},\, S_{0y0},\, S_{0y1},\, S_{00z},\, S_{01z},\, S_{000},\, S_{001},\, S_{010},\, S_{011} & \gets u_x = 0        \\
        S_{01z},\, S_{010},\, S_{011}                                                                   & \gets u_y = 0        \\
        S_{0y0},\, S_{010},\, S_{000}                                                                   & \gets u_z = 0        \\
        S_{1yz},\, S_{1y0},\, S_{1y1},\, S_{10z},\, S_{11z},\, S_{100},\, S_{101},\, S_{110},\, S_{111} & \gets u_x = U > 0\,.
    \end{align}
\end{subequations}
In simple terms, the whole $yz$-plane at $x=0$ (including corner and edge nodes) is fixed at zero displacement in the $x$-direction; the whole $y$-edge at $x,\,z=0$ (including corner nodes) is also fixed at zero displacement in the $z$-direction; the whole $z$-edge at $x = 0\,\, y = 1$ (including corner nodes) is fixed at zero displacement in the $y$-direction; and the whole $yz$-plane (including corner and edge nodes) nodes at $x=1$ have a displacement, $U > 0$, applied in the $x$-direction ($U < 0$ would be a compressive load). All other degrees of freedom are free to move as necessary.

Once mapped to our simulated cuboid geometry, it looks like \cref{f:tensileSetup}.

In EasyDD, time is defined in units of shear modulus \cref{eq:timeConversion},
\begin{align}\label{eq:timeConversion}
    t_{\rvar{real}} & = t_{\rvar{sim}} \dfrac{B}{\mu}\,,
\end{align}
where $B \coloneqq 1 \times 10^{-4}[\si{\pascal}][\si{\second}]$ is the dislocation mobility and $\mu \coloneqq [\si{\pascal}]$ is the shear modulus.\footnote{The shear modulus is normalised to 1, we use its magnitude to scale the values of the results accordingly. The edge dislocation mobility is also normalised to 1, other mobilities are defined as multiples of this.}

The experimental loading rates were $\SI{5}{\nano\metre/\second}$ and $\SI{500}{\nano\metre/\second}$, which when converted to simulation time, give loading rates that are far too low for the timescales we can simulate. As mentioned in \cref{ss:matrix}, it is important that a quasistatic condition is met for the mobility functions to hold. We therefore chose a loading rate that enabled simulations advance sufficiently without overloading the system. We settled on multiplying the converted value\footnote{The converted value used in the simulations is: $\left(\SI{5e-3}{\micro\metre}/a\right) \times \left(B /  \mu \right)$, where $a$ is the lattice parameter in micrometers, $B$ the dislocation mobility and $ \mu $ the magnitude of the shear modulus from \cref{eq:timeConversion}.} of the $\SI{5}{\nano\metre/\second}$ loading rate by a factor of $5 \times 10^6$. Any higher and the yield point increased massively, any lower and the simulations took much longer to advance without a significant drop in yield point.
